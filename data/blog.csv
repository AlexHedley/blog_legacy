6,Code Highlighting,"I've started making more tutorials and putting them up on here.
I was using a crude method of divs and classes to highlight different code which looked ok but I'd seen it looks much better on other sites so I went looking and found <a href=""http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/"" target=""_blank"">Syntax Highlighter</a> which does an amazing job.
I've used it on <a href=""http://alexhedley.com/testing/twitter.asp"">My Twitter integration tutorial<a/> locally and a quick hosted <a href=""http://alexhedley.com/workings/highlighter/index.html"">demo<a/>.
I think it makes the page look a lot better.
I'm gonna add it to my 599CD Classroom, hopefully in the next couple of days.",2011-02-14 10:20:49 +0000
7,Syntax Hightling Update,"So I've added a theme switcher to the syntax highlighting on the 599 pages and maybe other coding pages later, took a theme switcher I'd used from a magazine tutorial from a while back.
Need to style it so it looks better but its functional.",2011-02-16 05:06:52 +0000
8,Instagram,"I love <a href=""http://instagr.am/"" >Instagram</a> :)
I need to take more photos tho, just be more creative.

I've come across two sites since they released their <a href=""http://instagram.com/developer/"">API</a> that do some cool things.

The first is <a href=""http://instagoodies.com/"">Insta Goodies</a> ""Stickers of your Instagram photos!"" hence the reason I need to take more photos.

The next is <a href=""http://instagrid.me/"">Instagrid</a> - ""A Clean Web Gallery For Your Instagram Photos"", this is because there isn't an easy way on the web to see all your photos, you can scan through your feed on the iPhone app but it's small etc.

Hopefully more things will become available soon or make your own using the API!

10,Recent Theatre Visit,"I went to the JournalTyne Theatre   last night (3rd May '11) to see One-Man Star Wars by Charles Ross.
It is exactly what you think it will be.
Seems he's done a LOTRs too.
It took a little to get into it but was worth it. Helps if you have seen the first three moves (IV/V/VI) but there were some very funny moments in there own right.
He came back out at the end and had a little chat with us, seems it has been touring for about 10 years after an original 25min sketch of the first film that seemed to evolve to the trilogy.

He was supported by a comedian John Cooper who has created a rather brilliant character, Danny Pensive, be sure to check out the Gateshead video from his blog.
Hilarious use of words.
